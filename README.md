# Shortest Path Finding in OpenStreetMap Data

## Overview
This project implements a shortest path finding algorithm using OpenStreetMap (OSM) data. It allows users to compute the most efficient route between two points based on real-world map data.

## Features
- Parses OpenStreetMap (OSM) data to extract road networks.
- Implements shortest path algorithms such as Dijkstra's and A*.
- Supports multiple routing criteria such as distance and travel time.
- Provides visualization of the computed route.
- Can handle large-scale OSM datasets.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries:
  - `osmnx`
  - `networkx`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `geopandas`
  - `shapely`

To install dependencies, run:
```sh
pip install osmnx networkx matplotlib geopandas shapely
```

## Usage
### 1. Download OSM Data
You can download OpenStreetMap data using the `osmnx` library:
```python
import osmnx as ox
G = ox.graph_from_place("New York City, USA", network_type="drive")
```

### 2. Find the Shortest Path
```python
import networkx as nx

# Define origin and destination coordinates
orig = (40.748817, -73.985428)  # Example: Empire State Building
dest = (40.712776, -74.005974)  # Example: One World Trade Center

# Get nearest nodes in the graph
orig_node = ox.distance.nearest_nodes(G, orig[1], orig[0])
dest_node = ox.distance.nearest_nodes(G, dest[1], dest[0])

# Compute shortest path using Dijkstra's algorithm
route = nx.shortest_path(G, orig_node, dest_node, weight='length')

# Plot the route
ox.plot_graph_route(G, route, node_size=0)
```

### 3. Running the Application
To run the shortest path finder as a script, execute:
```sh
python shortest_path.py
```

## Dataset
The OSM data can be downloaded from:
- [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/)
- [Geofabrik](https://download.geofabrik.de/)

## Future Improvements
- Add support for real-time traffic data.
- Implement an interactive web interface.
- Support multiple transportation modes (walking, cycling, public transit).
